## Welcome to  My GitHub Pages

I have architected, developed and deployed solutions for a number of customers in NZ and Australia which involve:

- Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)
- ADFS WAP
- Azure Active Directory
- Azure Active Directory B2C
- Azure Graph API
- Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)
- Windows Identity Foundation (WIF)
- OWIN
- SAML 2.0
- WS-Federation
- OpenID Connect
- OAuth2

I am a Microsoft P-TSP for ADFS and Azure Identity in Auckland. 

As a co-admin, I run the [North Shore .NET User Group](http://northshore.netusergroup.org.nz/). 

We are also on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-NET-User-Group/).

I have presented at user groups and TechEd / Ignite NZ on Microsoft Identity. 

A list of my TechEd / Ignite NZ sessions is [here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/rory-braybrook).
